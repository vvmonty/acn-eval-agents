DESCRIPTION = """\
In the example below, your goal is to find out where \
Apple's SVP Software Engineering got his degree in engineering - \
without knowing the full name of that person ahead of time. \
\
Did you see why traditional RAG systems like this one \
can't reliably handle this type of "multi-hop" queries? \
Can you come up with more examples? Make note of your \
findings and share them with your teammates! \
\
The output format you see is also what the Agent LLM \
would receive when interacting with the knowledge base search \
tool in subsequent sections of this bootcamp - both when using \
the Wikipedia database we provided and when using your own \
public dataset.
